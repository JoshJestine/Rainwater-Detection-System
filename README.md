# Rainwater-Detection-System
Turfs often become inaccessible because of sudden rain. A mechanism is in place to close the Turf’s roof to prevent it from becoming wet. The said mechanism though has to be turned on manually with the press of a button and often isn’t in time to prevent the Turf from becoming wet. A Rain Water Detection Sensor could detect rain and immediately turn on the roof.

The rain alarm is an application that detects rainwater and sounds an alarm when it is detected. This thesis describes a simple and reliable sensor module that may be available in the market at low cost. Rain Alarm Project is a simple but very useful project that detects Rain (Rain Water) and automatically triggers an alarm or buzzer. Water is a basic need in every one’s life. Saving water and proper usage of water is very important. Here is a project which will give the alarm when there is rain, so that we can make some actions for rain water harvesting and also save the rain water for using it later. With the help of saving this rain water through rain water harvesting, we can increase the levels of underground water by using underwater recharge techniques.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, a rainwater detection system using NodeMCU ESP8266 can be a useful solution for maintaining a healthy turf. The system can be built using a rainwater sensor that detects the presence of water in the turf and sends a signal to the NodeMCU ESP8266. The NodeMCU can then use Wi-Fi connectivity to send data to a mobile device via the Blynk app, which can display the water level and send notifications if the water level reaches a certain threshold.

This system can be especially useful for monitoring the water level in turf during periods of drought or water scarcity, helping to ensure that the turf remains healthy while conserving water resources.

Overall, a rainwater detection system using ESP8266 is a great way to automate the process of monitoring rainfall and provide accurate data for a variety of purposes.
